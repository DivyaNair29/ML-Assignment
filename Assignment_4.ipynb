    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: 1) Categorical - Categorical data can be put in groups or categories using names or labels. This grouping is typically generated using a matching procedure based on data attributes and similarities between these qualities. The two types of categorical attributes are: Nominal and Ordinal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical - Data expressed in numerical terms rather than in natural language descriptions are called numerical data. It can only be gathered in numerical form, keeping its name. This numerical data type also referred to as quantitative data can be used to measure a person’s height, weight, IQ, etc. The two types of numerical attributes are: Discrete and Continuous data.\n",

    "In other words, you split the data into bins in order to view the distribution of values within a range. The bins are of equal length (and can be empty), and the bins are contiguous. The height of each bar represents the count (or proportion) of the items in the bin. The number of bins is up to the user, though Metabase will automatically select the number of bins for you.\n",

These plots are often called scatter graphs or scatter diagrams. Scatter plots instantly report a large volume of data. It is beneficial in the following situations –\n",
